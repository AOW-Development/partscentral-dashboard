  The Journey of a New Field

  Let's imagine you want to add a new field called "customerNotes" to the order form.

  ---

  1. Frontend: The User Interface (.../page.tsx)

  This is what the user sees and interacts with.

   * A. Update the State:
       * First, you need a place to store the value of the new field in the component's memory. You do this by adding it to the formData state.
       * File: partscentral-dashboard/app/orders/[id]/page.tsx
       * Code:
   1         const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
   2           email: "",
   3           mobile: "",
   4           customerNotes: "", // <-- Add the new field here
   5           // ... other fields
   6         });

   * B. Add the Input Field (UI):
       * Next, you need to add the actual input box to the screen so the user can type in it.
       * File: partscentral-dashboard/app/orders/[id]/page.tsx
       * Code (JSX):

   1         <div>
   2           <label>Customer Notes</label>
   3           <input
   4             type="text"
   5             value={formData.customerNotes}
   * C. Handle User Input (`handleInputChange`):
       * When the user types in the input box, the onChange event is triggered. This calls the handleInputChange function.
       * This function takes the new value from the input and updates the formData state with the new customerNotes value. This is how the
         component "remembers" what the user has typed.

  2. Frontend: The API Layer (.../orderApi.ts)

   * A. Include the New Field in the Payload:
       * When the "Create Order" button is clicked, the createOrderFromAdmin function is called. You need to make sure the new customerNotes
         field is included in the orderData object that gets sent to the backend.
       * File: partscentral-dashboard/utils/orderApi.ts
       * Code:

   1         const orderData = {
   2           // ... other info
   3           notes: formData.notes || '', // This already exists, maybe you add to it
   4           customerNotes: formData.customerNotes || '', // <-- Add the new field here
   5           // ... other info
   6         };

   * B. Send the Data (`fetch`):
       * The fetch function then takes the orderData object, converts it into a JSON string, and sends it to the backend as an HTTP POST
         request to the /api/orders endpoint.

  3. Backend: The Routing Layer (.../routes/orderRoutes.ts)

   * A. Define the Endpoint:
       * This file defines all the API endpoints related to orders. It maps a URL and an HTTP method (e.g., POST /api/orders) to a specific
         controller function.
       * File: database/src/routes/orderRoutes.ts (I'm assuming this file exists)
       * Purpose: To direct incoming requests to the correct controller function. It's like a traffic cop for the API.

  ---

  4. Backend: The Controller Layer (.../controllers/orderController.ts)

  The controller is the "brain" of the backend operation.

   * A. Receive and Validate Data:
       * The controller function (e.g., createOrder) receives the orderData from the request body.
       * Its primary job is to validate the incoming data (e.g., make sure required fields are present) and to orchestrate the business logic.
         It doesn't contain the business logic itself, but it calls the services that do.
       * File: database/src/controllers/orderController.ts (I'm assuming this file exists)
       * Purpose: To manage the flow of data between the router and the services.

  ---

  5. Backend: The Service Layer (.../services/orderService.ts)

   * A. Execute Business Logic:
       * The service function (e.g., createOrder) takes the data from the controller and performs the actual work.
       * This is where you might perform calculations, interact with other services, or prepare the data in the exact format the database
         expects.
       * File: database/src/services/orderService.ts (I'm assuming this file exists)
       * Purpose: To separate the business logic from the request/response handling of the controller.
   * A. Update the Database Schema:
       * Before you can save the new customerNotes field, you need to tell the database that it exists. In this project, you're using Prisma,
         so you would update the schema.prisma file.
       * File: database/prisma/schema.prisma
       * Code:
   1         model Order {
   2           id            String   @id @default(cuid())
   3           // ... other fields
   4           customerNotes String? // <-- Add the new field to the model
   5         }
       * After updating the schema, you would run a database migration (npx prisma migrate dev) to apply the changes to the actual database.

   * B. Save the Data:
  Frontend (`page.tsx`) -> API Layer (`orderApi.ts`) -> Backend (`fetch`) -> Router (`orderRoutes.ts`) -> Controller (`orderController.ts`)
  -> Service (`orderService.ts`) -> Database (`schema.prisma`)

  This entire structure is a very common and robust way to build applications, as it separates concerns and makes the code easier to manage
  and debug.

  I hope this detailed explanation is helpful! Let me know if you'd like me to clarify any of these points.
