location /socket.io/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001/socket.io/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
}

You mean this should be like this :
(cause /api/ is backend so ? right ?)

location /socket.io/ {
    proxy_pass http://parscentral.us/api/socket.io/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
}

also my grave concern is fetching years route in backend which is being used my both frontends so how does backend know which frotend to return/call/send ??
